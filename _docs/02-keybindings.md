Browsh attempts, where ever possible, to retain the conventional keybindings
you would usually associate with a desktop browser. Even so, for clarity here
are all the keybindings.

## General

`ARROW KEYS` Scrolling    
`CTRL+l` Focus the URL bar   
`CTRL+q` Exit app    

## Miscellaneous

`ALT+P`  Take screenshot. The status bar will display the saved path
